# Installation:

- Download the latest ClanTagRank.dll from the release page, and place it in your t6 server under ```./t6r/data/plugins```, and ClanTagRankApi.dll (from https://gitea.insanemode.org/INSANEMODE/ClanTagRankApi ) in your Iw4m-admin folder under ```./Plugins```

- Run your server, and GetClanTag.ini will be generated in your ```./t6r/data/plugins``` folder. you can edit the URL in this file to match your iw4m-admin url or port if you aren't running it locally, or if you are not running on the default 1624 port.
