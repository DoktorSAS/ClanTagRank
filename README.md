# Warning: 

This plugin is currently only intended to run on Plutonium t6 zombies!

# Description:

This C++ Plutonium t6 plugin and  C# iw4m-admin plugin are used together to grab the iw4m-admin role for a player name, and set it as their clan tag in game.

# Installation:

- Download the latest ClanTagRank.dll from the release page, and place it in your t6 server under ```./t6r/data/plugins```, and ClanTagRankCommands.dll (from https://gitea.insanemode.org/INSANEMODE/ClanTagRankCommands ) in your Iw4m-admin folder under ```./Plugins```

- everything is now handled through rcon, so there is no longer a need to set your iw4m-admin url in the config file. it can be safely deleted.
